He now leads the Continuous Improvement program at Mercer's Celgar Pulp Mill, where he helps bring a traditional industry into the digital age.

In his talk, Koowar will be sharing a recent project that automated the entire process of starting up and shutting down a complex part of the production plant. The project also delivered real time decision support tools for helping operators through upset conditions as well as a training simulator to accelerate up-skilling operators.
