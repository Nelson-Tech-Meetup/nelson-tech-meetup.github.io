🎄 Holiday Tech Social at Torchlight Brewing 🎄

We’re closing out the year with a festive tech meetup at Torchlight Brewing, and you’re invited! Join us from 6–8 PM for casual tech chats, holiday cheer, and holiday bingo with prizes. 🎁

Wear your best (or worst) holiday sweater, grab a drink, and connect with fellow tech folks.
