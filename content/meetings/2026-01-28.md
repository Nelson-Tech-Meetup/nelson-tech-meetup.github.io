Join us for an evening exploring how climate and weather data are transformed into useful information for decision-making. Two local speakers will share their work on climate data systems in British Columbia.

## From Climate Data to Climate Indicator–Based Risk Assessment
**Jonathan Doyle**

While high-quality climate data is now widely available, turning massive datasets into locally relevant [climate indicators](https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/environmental-indicators/climate.html) remains a challenge. Jonathan will demonstrate how Python tools like [xclim](https://xclim.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), [xarray](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/), and [Dask](http://docs.dask.org/en/stable/) are used to process terabytes of climate projections and calculate meaningful indicators for specific regions.

The talk features a demonstration of the Localized Climate Analysis and Projection (LCAP) system, developed in partnership with [Selkirk Innovates](https://selkirk.ca/research-innovation/selkirk-innovates). This web tool helps communities assess climate-related risks to infrastructure and make informed adaptation decisions.

## Weather to Run: Turning weather and climate observations into usable data
**James Heibert**

BC's dramatic climate variation—from coastal rainforests to glaciated mountains—makes weather monitoring both critical and challenging. James will describe how the province uses Python and open-source tools to build and maintain BC's Provincial Climate Data Set (PCDS), which collects real-time observations from weather stations across the province.

Using a relatable example—calculating the percentage of "runnable days" per year based on temperature and precipitation—James will show how good data infrastructure enables meaningful climate analysis across different regions and time periods.
