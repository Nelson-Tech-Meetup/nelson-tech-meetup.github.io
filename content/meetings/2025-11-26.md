## Think Global, Act Local: Unpacking Sovereign AI
Join Justin Watts (they/them), Distinguished Engineer at TELUS, for a critical exploration of sovereign AI. Drawing on their Anthropology background and leadership in TELUS's generative AI initiatives, Justin will examine how we can build AI systems that respect data sovereignty, cultural contexts, and local governance while operating in a global ecosystem. Discover frameworks for developing technology that serves communities responsibly while balancing innovation with human dignity.

## Agentic AI for Automating Sys Admin Tasks
Software engineer Dan Nesbitt, founder of the Kootenay Lake Innovation Centre and Kootenay Lightweb Co-op, demonstrates how agentic AI can revolutionize systems administration. Using the n8n framework, Dan shows how to treat automation like training a competent employee—one that observes environments, reasons through problems intelligently, takes safe corrective actions, and knows when to escalate to humans. Get practical configurations for implementing AI-driven automation in cloud, on-premises, or hybrid environments.

## From Cameras to the Printing Press, Is AI Any Different?
Local artist Zen Wang invites us to step back and consider AI through the lens of history. Drawing from Yuval Noah Harari's "Nexus: A Brief History of Information Networks from the Stone Age to AI," Zen will explore how each transformative information technology—from writing to the printing press to photography—has reshaped human society. Is AI just the latest chapter in this ongoing story, or does it represent something fundamentally different? Join us for a thought-provoking journey through the evolution of how humans create, share, and are shaped by information networks.
