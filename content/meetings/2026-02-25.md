Cozy up with your favourite tea and take in 3 engaging talks on Artificial Intelligence by local tech experts!

## Ralph Wiggum Loops
**Matt Wynne**

What does Ralph Wiggum have to do with software engineering? Matt will share his experiences playing with Ralph loops, a technique for letting robots like Claude code run unattended. He'll talk about other multi-agent workflows and tools including his own "yak mapping" tool.

## Working Smarter with Claude
**Gregg Coppen**

This talk explores how Claude, Anthropic's AI assistant, can help anyone work smarter — whether you're a business professional streamlining daily tasks or a developer building AI-powered workflows. We'll walk through real-world use cases across skill levels and show why Claude's ability to follow nuanced instructions and produce thoughtful, well-reasoned outputs makes it worth exploring.

## The State of the Art
**Ola Rogula**

Artificial Intelligence continues to be a controversial topic in the artistic fields. Ola will give an update of the state of the tool among industries and artistic fields, and what we can learn from looking at the integration of similar yet different tools in the past.
